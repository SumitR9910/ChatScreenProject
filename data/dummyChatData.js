  { message: "On it. Iâ€™ll add the UTM structure to the campaign brief." },
  { message: "Letâ€™s do a dry run of everything on November 10." },
  { message: "Agreed. That gives us buffer to tweak before launch." },
  { message: "Should we prepare press kits or media outreach for this one?" },
  { message: "Not this time. Letâ€™s focus entirely on performance channels." },
  { message: "Got it. Will route all traffic to the campaign landing page." },
  { message: "Can we add testimonials from last yearâ€™s users to the page?" },

    message:
      "We should also prep a crisis response plan in case the product glitches.",
  },
  { message: "True. Iâ€™ll coordinate with support and draft an FAQ too." },
